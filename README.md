THIS MOD MUST BE SYMLINKED WITH GAMEAPI TO BE BUILT MANUALLY. IT IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE DECOMPILATION

This is a mod that returns Mighty's Wall Jump from Chaotix. To use it, simply be in a ball next to a wall, and hold towards it and press the button. Holding it will keep you stuck to the wall, and releasing with different directional inputs will influence how Mighty jumps off. It is built to be very close to how it felt in Knuckles Chaotix, allowing for all sorts of wall scaling fun!
